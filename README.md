# gemini-vision

A demo of Google's latest vision based AI model, [gemini-pro-vision](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/).

**[TRY IT HERE!](https://chiroyce1.github.io/gemini-vision/)** (bring your own API key...)


## API Key
You can obtain a free API key for `gemini-vision-pro` from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/), then paste it into the `API_KEY` password input field. Don't worry it won't be saved or sent anywhere, except along with the requests to Google's server running Gemini.

## Server Side Request
Use the [`server`](https://github.com/Chiroyce1/gemini-vision/tree/server) branch to run a flask server with an API_KEY stored in `.env`, so that users can use it without having to bring their own key. Documentation in the `README.md` of that branch. 

## Extra
- Yes the UI is wonky, it was just plain HTML yesterday but I decided to make it a bit ✨ pretty ✨ so it looks presentable, feel free to make pull requests for UI improvements.
- Any bugs/issues with a specific browser/OS or in general, make an issue [here](https://github.com/Chiroyce1/gemini-vision/issues).
